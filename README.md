# APPLES AND CARROTS: Sophia's Farm Adventure!
Created by Tara, Andy, and Caileigh. 

# Our Main Character:
  Sophia is a down-to-earth and responsible bunny. She owns a farm on the island of Victoria, where she cares for her two brothers and is a kind and positive member of the Rabbitsville community. Her daily chores start early each morning and involve her duties to her farm, family, and village. She loves all three!
  
# Apples and Carrots - Storyline:
  GAME 1: Carrot Harvest (Caileigh)
  
  Sophie begins her day at the carrot fields! The player is tasked with helping her collect carrots that pop out of the ground when mature, carrots she must bring back to her baby bunny brothers for their breakfast. The more carrots collected before breakfast is over, the more points for the player (and the happier the baby bunnies!)
  
  GAME 2: Apple Catch (Andy)
  
  
  GAME 3: Farmer's Market (Tara)
  Have her basket full of apples and carrots, then two empty baskets labelled for apples and carrots to sort produce into
